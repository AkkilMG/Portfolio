    overview: [
        'MoE-Bot is an automated solution designed for the online game Rival Regions, specifically aimed at assisting the Minister of Economy (MoE) role. The bot uses automation to handle repetitive and time-consuming economic tasks, such as refilling resources (gold, oil, ore, uranium, and diamond) and managing economic operations within the game. Built using Python and Selenium, MoE-Bot simulates human interactions on the web, allowing for efficient resource management without manual intervention.', 
        'By automating the in-game economic tasks, MoE-Bot reduces the workload for players holding the MoE position, enabling them to focus on strategic decision-making rather than routine tasks. The bot interacts with the Rival Regions website, overcoming challenges such as Cloudflare protection and login authentication, making it a versatile tool for players who want to optimize their in-game economy management.',
        'MoE-Bot streamlines the responsibilities of the MoE role in Rival Regions, making economic management more accessible and less tedious.'
